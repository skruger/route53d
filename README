INTRODUCTION

route53d is a DNS frontend to the Amazon Route 53 API. It allows you to
use standard DNS tools to make changes to your Route 53 zones. At the
moment it supports adding and deleting resource records by dynamic
update (e.g with nsupdate).

Support for slaving from your master DNS server by incremental zone
transfer (IXFR) and pushing zones changes to the API is nearly complete.


REQUIREMENTS

 + Python
   http://www.python.org/
 + boto
   https://github.com/boto/boto
   Route 53 support isn't yet in a Boto release. Take a source snapshot
   from Github.
 + dnspython
   http://www.dnspython.org/
 + An active Amazon Route53 account
   http://aws.amazon.com/route53/
 + AWS access keys

INSTALLATION

1. Install Python, dnspython and Boto according to their documentation.
   This may help: http://aws.amazon.com/articles/3998
2. route53d uses Boto to call the Route53 API. Configure Boto with your
   AWS access key: http://code.google.com/p/boto/wiki/BotoConfig
3. Create a config file. Use route53d.ini.sample as the starting point.
4. Start the daemon:  route53d.py [--config /path/to/route53d.ini]


LIMITATIONS

 + Resource-record deletion
   The DNS dynamic update mechanism allows deletion of 1) a specific
   resource-record, 2) a resource-record set, or 3) deletion of all
   records belonging to a name. The Route 53 API implements only
   specific resource-record deletion so route53d will reject requests
   for the other deletion types.
